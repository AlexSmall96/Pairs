## Responsiveness
- The site has been tested for responsiveness on a range of browser sizes. These range in width from 320px to 2560px. Both pages are fully responsive in both easy and hard mode, maintaining their structural integrity across all browser sizes. 

- The site uses media queries to change the width of the game page, font size, icon size and card padding depending on the browser size.

### Issues Found
- At narrow browser sizes (<450px in width), the card area begins to look cluttered. This is due to the number of cards that are involved with hard mode. The easy mode layout has to accommodate this as the media queries apply to both easy and hard mode. The game also requires extra space in the margins of the card area, as the cards increase in width when turned over due to the question mark icon being narrower than the others.

- As a fix for this issue, further developments of this project might involve using javascript to make the site responsive at these small browser sizes, allowing the details of the media queries to be dependent on the difficulty level chosen.

- Another solution may be to ensure the cards stay at the same width even when turned over. This would mean there is less margin space needed around the card table.

## User Stories Testing
The site has been tested according to the user stories and fulfils all user needs:

As a user, I would like to :

- See clearly what the purpose of the game is
   - The home page is very clear and has a snappy about section at the top. The title of the game is also simple and well known as it is a classic game.
- Receive clear and concise instructions as to how to navigate the site and play the game
   - The instructions feature direclty  below the about section on the home page, and are clear and concise, explaining in enough detail the rules and navigation of the game
- Easily navigate the site through eye catching buttons
   -Throughout the site, buttons are eye catching and easy to locate. They appear or disappear at the right times to allow the user to have the smoothest experience possible while playing the game.
- Be able to view my progress as I am playing the game
   - The items found icons update when cards are matched, and the number of items to left is stated to the user, along with the attempts left.
- Receive prompts during the game to know what to do next
   - At the end of each turn the user is told whether to keep guessing if correct or to press a button to turn the cards over if incorrect. 
- Record my result and compare to other players
   - If a username enters their username and makes it to the top 3, their result is saved on the leaderboard along with other users who have played the game on that browser.
- Be able to exit the game or play again at the end of each game
   - At the end of the game the user has the option to start a new game, by taking them to the settings menu regardless of if they win or lose. At any point in the game the user can exit to the home screen.

## Validation Testing
### CSS Validation
The style.css file passes through the official [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) without any errors.
![](assets/documentation/images/css-pass.png)
### HTML Validation
The index.html file passes through the official [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) without any errors.
![](assets/documentation/images/html-pass.png)
### JS Validation 
The script.js file passes through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) without any errors. The validator produces the following metrics: 

- There are 10 functions in this file.

- Function with the largest signature take 2 arguments, while the median is 0.

- Largest function has 41 statements in it, while the median is 5.5.

- The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 15 while the median is 1.

The validator also gives a warning : "	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (attemptsLeft, card, inputId, inputName, itemsFound, noItems, username, scores, difficulty)"

I chose to ignore this warning as I was confident in the logic of my code that the way the functions and variables declared wouldn't affect the functionality. Further developments of this project might involve looking into declaring the function in a way that doesn't reference outer scoped variables.
