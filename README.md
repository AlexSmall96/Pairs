# Pairs
## ⚠️ARCHIVED PROJECT

**This is an archived project from my bootcamp with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) in 2023, kept for historical reference. It does not represent my current skill level or tech stack.**

This site is a fun and playful remake of the classic card matching game Pairs. The game is played by clicking on cards to reveal an array of random items, ranging from pizza slices and burgers, to motorcycles and space shuttles. Players have to turn over two cards at a time, with the aim of finding a matching pair. Those that complete the game within the given number of attempts have a chance of being entered onto the leaderboard.

This game is a great test of memory, concentration and focus. Memory games such as Pairs have been shown to improve cognitive abilities over the long term.

## Content
The content of the site is all original thought, however the game itself is based on the classic card game [Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) (also known as Pairs or Pelmanism).
## Code
The resources used for this project were the CI Javascript Essentials module, HTML & CSS Essentials module, the Love Running and Love Maths walkthrough projects, along with some external resources:

- The code which sorts the leaderboard based on user's scores is taken from an article from [medium.com](https://medium.com/@gmcharmy/sort-objects-in-javascript-e-c-how-to-get-sorted-values-from-an-object-142a9ae7157c).

- The difficulty switch on the home page is styled with inspiration from a guide found at [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-toggle-switch-by-using-html-and-css/).

- The CSS background effects were taken from a section on [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp) and a thread on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2869212/css3-gradient-background-set-on-body-doesnt-stretch-but-instead-repeats/). 

- All external resources are commented in the code at the relevant places.
