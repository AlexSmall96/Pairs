# Pairs
## ⚠️ARCHIVED PROJECT

**This is an archived project from my bootcamp with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) in 2023, kept for historical reference. It does not represent my current skill level or tech stack.**

This site is a remake of the classic card matching game Pairs, created using HTML, CSS, and JS during my early learning phase.
